  bio: "I work in Supply Chain and Procurement, where solving problems requires more than dashboards — it requires understanding processes, people, and execution realities. Currently working as a Senior Analyst at Capgemini, I sit at the intersection of data analysis, process improvement, and operational decision-making, helping translate complex situations into clear, actionable solutions. My approach is grounded in on-ground process flow, execution challenges, and stakeholder realities, supported by data — not driven by tools alone.",
